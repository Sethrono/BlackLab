== BLACKLAB ==

This is a fork of the open source Java implementation of BlackLab (https://github.com/INL/BlackLab) ported to work with SBT, and has some fixes to reduce memory usage.

It gets published to Maven Central under package name `org.allenai.blacklab`. All package referenences are changed from `nl.inl` to `org.allenai` in the Java source code.

=== What is BlackLab? ===

BlackLab is a corpus retrieval engine built on top of [http://lucene.apache.org/ Apache Lucene]. It allows fast, complex searches with accurate hit highlighting on large, tagged and annotated, bodies of text. It was developed at the Institute of Dutch Lexicology (INL) to provide a fast and feature-rich search
interface on our historical and contemporary text corpora.

We're also working on BlackLab Server, a web service interface to BlackLab, so you can access it from any programming language. See the ALPHA version here: https://github.com/INL/BlackLab-server
